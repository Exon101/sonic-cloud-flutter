Task: Build a Flutter app implementing the Sonic Cloud design system across 4 screens (My Library, Now Playing, Cloud Storage, Settings), based on the previously analyzed HTML mockups and YAML design tokens.

Work Log:
- Created project skeleton at /home/z/my-project/download/sonic_cloud_flutter/ with pubspec.yaml, analysis_options.yaml, README.md
- Built the design token layer in lib/theme/: app_colors.dart (full Material-3 palette from YAML), app_typography.dart (Montserrat headlines + Inter body/labels via google_fonts), app_spacing.dart (4px spacing scale + CORRECTED radius scale: lg=16px, xl=24px — the HTML had every radius halved)
- Built typed models in lib/models/models.dart: Track, Album, CloudDrive, UserProfile, SyncActivity
- Populated lib/data/mock_data.dart with the same track art URLs and metadata as the HTML mockups so visual parity is 1:1
- Built 7 reusable widgets in lib/widgets/:
  - GlassCard: BackdropFilter(blur 20) + 5% white fill + 1px top/left light-edge border per spec
  - AmbientBackground: deep indigo gradient + soft primary-container blob
  - SonicGlowButton: pulsing cyan play button with 30-60% animated outer glow
  - WaveformProgress: 45-bar sine-modulated waveform seek bar with glowing playhead + drag-to-seek
  - SonicTopAppBar: 80% surface tint + 24px blur + avatar + wordmark + search
  - SonicBottomNavBar: 90% surface-container + 40px blur + active icon glow
  - AlbumCard, TrackRow (with animated pulse bars on active track)
- Built 4 screens in lib/screens/:
  - my_library_screen.dart: search field, 4 filter chips, Recently Played horizontal carousel, All Songs list with one active track
  - now_playing_screen.dart: minimal top bar, vinyl-style circular album art with pulsing outer ring + spindle hole, track info, waveform seek bar, glassmorphic playback controls pill
  - cloud_storage_screen.dart: storage overview with sonic-seeker progress, responsive 1/2/3-col connected drives grid with per-drive toggles, recent sync activity list
  - settings_screen.dart: profile card, Connections group, Playback group (with Offline Mode toggle), Log Out button — single responsive layout (fixes the HTML's broken desktop placeholder)
- Wired up lib/main.dart: MaterialApp with AppTheme.dark(), AmbientBackground wrapping an IndexedStack that swaps the 4 screens, Now Playing pushed as a full-screen route (bottom nav suppressed per spec)
- Verified imports and structure; cleaned up one unused import in now_playing_screen.dart
- Wrote README.md with run instructions and a fidelity table documenting which tokens match spec and which bugs from the HTML analysis were fixed

Stage Summary:
- Deliverable: complete Flutter project at /home/z/my-project/download/sonic_cloud_flutter/
- 18 Dart files, ~3,100 lines of code, 4 fully-designed screens, 7 reusable widgets, 5 typed models
- Design system fidelity: every color, typography size, spacing step, and component pattern from sonic_cloud.md is implemented
- HTML analysis bugs fixed: radius tokens halved (corrected to lg=16px, xl=24px), missing body-sm token added, Settings desktop view made functional, no duplicate stylesheets, bottom nav correctly suppressed on Now Playing
- Out of scope (deliberately): audio playback, real cloud sync, persistence, auth flow — all mock data
